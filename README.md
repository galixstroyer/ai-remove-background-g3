# AI Remove Background for GIMP 3.0

A powerful GIMP 3.0.4+ plugin that uses AI models to automatically remove backgrounds from images, with support for multiple AI models, custom backgrounds, and batch processing.

## About

**AI Remove Background** is an open-source GIMP plugin developed by [Gideon DeHaan](https://gideondehaan.dev), a 13-year-old programmer passionate about making advanced image editing tools accessible to everyone.

This plugin integrates the popular `rembg` Python library with GIMP 3.0, providing professional-quality background removal directly within your favorite image editor.

## Features

- **Multiple AI Models**: Choose from 8 different AI models optimized for various use cases:
  - `u2net` - General purpose background removal
  - `u2net_human_seg` - Optimized for human subjects
  - `u2net_cloth_seg` - Specialized for clothing/fashion
  - `u2netp` - Lightweight version for faster processing
  - `silueta` - High-quality silhouette extraction
  - `isnet-general-use` - Advanced model for general use
  - `isnet-anime` - Optimized for anime/illustration style images
  - `sam` - Segment Anything Model for versatile segmentation

- **Flexible Background Options**:
  - Transparent background (default)
  - White background
  - Black background
  - Custom color background (supports hex colors with alpha)

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Alpha matting for smoother edges
  - Optional layer mask creation
  - Square canvas resizing
  - Batch processing for multiple open images
  - Preserves layer offsets and positioning

## Requirements

- **GIMP 3.0.4** or newer
- **Python 3.8+** with the following packages:
  - `rembg` (install via pip)
  - `gi` (Python GObject Introspection - usually comes with GIMP)
- **System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows

## Installation

### Step 1: Install rembg

First, you need to install the `rembg` Python package. The plugin looks for it in `~/.rembg/bin/python` by default:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv ~/.rembg
~/.rembg/bin/pip install rembg

# Or install globally (not recommended)
pip install rembg
```

### Step 2: Install the Plugin

1. **Download the plugin file**: `ai-remove-background-g3.py`

2. **Find your GIMP plugins directory**:
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\`

3. **Create a plugin directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/ai-remove-background-g3
   ```

4. **Copy the plugin file**:
   ```bash
   cp ai-remove-background-g3.py ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/ai-remove-background-g3/
   ```

5. **Make the plugin executable** (Linux/macOS only):
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.config/GIMP/3.0/plug-ins/ai-remove-background-g3/ai-remove-background-g3.py
   ```

6. **Restart GIMP**

The plugin will appear in the menu under **Filters ‚Üí AI ‚Üí AI Remove Background‚Ä¶**

## Usage

1. Open an image in GIMP
2. Select the layer you want to process
3. Go to **Filters ‚Üí AI ‚Üí AI Remove Background‚Ä¶**
4. Configure your options:
   - **Model**: Choose the AI model best suited for your image
   - **Alpha Matting**: Enable for smoother edges (increases processing time)
   - **Background Mode**: Select transparent, white, black, or custom color
   - **Make Square**: Optionally resize canvas to square dimensions
   - **Process All Images**: Apply to all open images in batch mode
5. Click **OK** to process

### Tips for Best Results

- **Human portraits**: Use `u2net_human_seg` model
- **Product photography**: Use `isnet-general-use` or `u2net`
- **Clothing/fashion**: Use `u2net_cloth_seg`
- **Anime/illustrations**: Use `isnet-anime`
- **Complex scenes**: Try `sam` model with alpha matting enabled

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin doesn't appear in menu
- Ensure the plugin file is executable (Linux/macOS)
- Check that the plugin is in its own directory: `ai-remove-background-g3/ai-remove-background-g3.py`
- Verify GIMP version is 3.0.4 or newer
- Check GIMP's Error Console (Windows ‚Üí Dockable Dialogs ‚Üí Error Console)

### "Python executable not found" error
- Install rembg in the default location: `~/.rembg/bin/python`
- Or specify a custom Python path in the plugin dialog
- Ensure Python has rembg installed: `python -m pip list | grep rembg`

### "rembg failed" error
- Check that rembg is properly installed with all dependencies
- Try running rembg from command line to test: `python -m rembg.cli --help`
- Some models download on first use - ensure you have internet connection
- Check available disk space for model downloads (~100-500MB per model)

### Poor quality results
- Try different AI models - each is optimized for different image types
- Enable Alpha Matting for smoother edges
- Adjust the Alpha Matting Erode Size (default: 15)
- Ensure your input image has good contrast between subject and background

## Advanced Configuration

### Using a Different Python Installation

If you have rembg installed in a different Python environment, you can specify the path in the plugin dialog's "Python executable" field. Examples:
- Conda: `/home/user/miniconda3/envs/myenv/bin/python`
- System Python: `/usr/bin/python3`
- Virtual environment: `/path/to/venv/bin/python`

### Batch Processing

Enable "Process all open images" to apply the same background removal settings to multiple images at once. This is useful for:
- Product photography workflows
- Portrait sessions
- Creating consistent assets for games/websites

### Custom Background Colors

When using Custom background mode, you can specify colors in these formats:
- `#RRGGBB` - Standard hex color (e.g., `#FF5733`)
- `#RRGGBBAA` - Hex color with alpha channel (e.g., `#FF5733CC`)
